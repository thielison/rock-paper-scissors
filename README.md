# rock-paper-scissors

This repository is the result of my first project from scratch, developed right after learning the essential HTML, CSS, and Javascript concepts.

The aim of this project is to implement the famous "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user plays against the machine. I used my newly acquired knowledge to create a simple and intuitive interface and applied DOM manipulation, programming logic, conditionals, and functions to create the game's logic.

Although it is a simple project, I am very proud of my progress and believe that this is an excellent way to share my learning with the community.

Feel free to clone the repository, take a look at the code, and make suggestions to improve it. Any feedback is welcome!

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope you enjoy playing "Rock, Paper, Scissors".
